# Preface


# The Parts

## Access your AWS EC2
 
Open an SSH client. Locate your privat key used to launch the instance. Run the command if necessary, to ensure the key in no publically viewble.

On Linux, it is as easy as using the `chmod`:
```{bash eval = FALSE}
chmod 400 csgkp.pem
```

Connect to your instance using its public DNS. For example:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
 ssh -i "csgkp.pem" user@[machine].[region].compute.amazonaws.com
```

```{bash, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
 ssh -i "csgkp.pem" ec2-user@ec2-18-223-43-27.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

Voila! You now have access to your server from the terminal.

## Setting up the required components

First, install and set up Git:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
sudo yum install git -y
```

Check the install:

```{bash eval = FALSE}
git --version
```

You will also need to set up the basic Git configuration:

```{bash eval = FALSE}
git config --global user.name "Your Username"
git config --global user.email "Your Email ID"
```

Check that it worked:

```{bash eval = FALSE}
git config --list
```

Now clone this repo into the server:

```{bash eval = FALSE}
git clone 
```
